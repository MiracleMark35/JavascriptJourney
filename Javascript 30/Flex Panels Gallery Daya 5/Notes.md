# ✅ Why are all the panels centered?
```css
This is the reason:

flex: 1;
display: flex;
justify-content: center;
align-items: center;
flex-direction: column;
```

flex: 1; → each panel takes up equal space inside .panels (since .panels is a flex container).

display: flex; → makes each panel itself a flexbox container.

justify-content: center; → centers content horizontally (main axis).

align-items: center; → centers content vertically (cross axis).

flex-direction: column; → stacks children (<p>) vertically.

👉 So yes, that’s why all text inside each panel is perfectly centered in the middle.

# ✅ What does .panel > * mean?
```css
.panel > * { ... }
```

> = direct child selector.

* = matches any element.

# So .panel > * means:
👉 “Select every element that is a direct child of .panel.”

In your code, each .panel contains 3 <p> elements, so .panel > * applies styles to those <p> tags.

# ✅ First-child & last-child
```css
.panel > *:first-child { transform: translateY(-100%); }
.panel.open-active > *:first-child { transform: translateY(0); }

.panel > *:last-child { transform: translateY(100%); }
.panel.open-active > *:last-child { transform: translateY(0); }
```

:first-child → selects the first <p> inside the panel.

:last-child → selects the last <p> inside the panel.

At first, they are moved up or down (translateY(-100%) or translateY(100%)), so you don’t see them.
When the panel opens (.open-active added), they slide back into place (translateY(0)).

# ✅ What does nth-child mean?
```css
.panel p:nth-child(2) {
  font-size: 4em;
}
```

nth-child(2) → selects the second <p> inside .panel.

So in each panel, the middle word (Let's, Take, It, etc.) is larger text.

#   What happens with .panel.open?
```css
.panel.open {
  font-size: 40px;
  flex: 5;
}
```

flex: 5; → makes the clicked panel expand (grow bigger compared to the others).

font-size: 40px; → makes its text bigger when open.

# 👉 In short:

.panel > * = all direct children (<p>s).

:first-child, :last-child, :nth-child(2) = specific positions of those children.

Flexbox (justify-content, align-items) is what makes everything centered.

# .toggle()

The .toggle('classname') method will:

Add the class if it’s not already there.

Remove the class if it is already there.

So it’s like a switch ON/OFF for a CSS class.
