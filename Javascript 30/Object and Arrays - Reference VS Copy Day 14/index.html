    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100; // 100
    let age2 = age; // 100
    console.log(age, age2)
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2) // 200 100
    //WHY because they are assigned at the same time

    // Same with strings

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    const teams = players;

   //  teams[3] = 'Lux'

    console.log(players, teams) // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux', 'Allan']
    // WHY Beacuse Team is the reference of the original array


   // players.push('Allan')
   //console.log(players, teams) //Both are  ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy', 'Allan']

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
   
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice(); // If no parameters it passes the whole array
    // now it is  a copy
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(team3) // same as the players name
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; // what spread will do is take every item out of your iterable 
                                // And Put it into the containing array
                                // An iterable can be iterated over withh for loops
    // ALSO YOU CAN DO THIS
    
    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.age = 90; // this is wrong it is a reference 
                      // this changes the original array
    // how do we take a copy instead?              // THIS HERE IS ADD EXTRA IF NEEDED ADD NEW OR EDIT
    const newCaptain = Object.assign({} ,person, {age: 100, number: '09985689462'})
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const newCaptain2 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const mark = {
        name: 'Mark Frost',
        social: {
            facebook: 'markian',
            instagram: 'mark99'
        }
    }

    const newMark = Object.assign( {}, mark); // its only one deep
    console.log(mark);
    console.log(newMark);
    newMark.social.facebook = 'GWAPO';  // it changes the original array because of one level

    const newMark3 = structuredClone(mark);
    newMark3.social.instagram = ' Dont Change';
    // NOW IT IS A COPY OF THE OBJECT
