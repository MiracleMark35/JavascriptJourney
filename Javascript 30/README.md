# JavaScript 30 (by Wes Bos) 🎉

This folder contains my solutions and notes for the **[JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/)** challenge by Wes Bos.  
The challenge consists of **30 vanilla JavaScript projects** built in 30 days — no frameworks, no libraries, no boilerplate, just **pure JS**.

## 📚 Purpose  

- Strengthen my JavaScript fundamentals.  
- Practice **DOM manipulation, events, ES6 features, and APIs**.  
- Build small, functional projects that improve problem-solving and creativity.  
- Document my learning progress along the way.
