# This line is for browser compatibility.
```javascript
window.SpeechRecognition = window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition;
```
“If the browser has window.SpeechRecognition, use it. Otherwise, fall back to window.webkitSpeechRecognition.”

# 2.

```javascript
const recognition = new SpeechRecognition();
```

Here you’re creating an instance of the speech recognition service.
You must use new to create it, because SpeechRecognition is a constructor function (class).

If you just did:
```javascript
const recognition = window.SpeechRecognition;
```

Then recognition would only be a reference to the class itself, not an actual working speech recognizer. You wouldn’t be able to start it.

# 3.

```javascript
let p = document.createElement('p');
```

This creates a <p> element in memory (not yet shown on the page).
So p is just a variable holding that <p> element.

# 4. contenteditable
```html
<div class="words" contenteditable></div>
```

contenteditable means the user can edit the content directly like a text editor.
So you can click inside that <div> and type in it.

# 5.
```javascript
words.appendChild(p);
```

This takes the <p> you created and inserts it into the .words div (the one that’s contenteditable).
Now that <p> is visible in the page.

# 6.
```javascript
recognition.addEventListener('result', (e) => { ... });
```

The "result" event fires whenever the speech recognition captures speech and converts it to text.

e.results contains all the recognition results.

recognition.addEventListener('end', () => recognition.start());

The "end" event fires when the speech recognition stops listening.
It can happen because:

You stopped talking

Or the browser ended the session automatically

The code calls recognition.start() again so it keeps listening forever, instead of stopping after one sentence.

# ✅ Summary:

window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition = browser compatibility.

new SpeechRecognition() = create an actual speech recognizer.

let p = document.createElement('p'); = new <p> element.

contenteditable = makes an element editable like an input.

appendChild() = adds a child element inside another.

"result" event = fires when speech is recognized.

"end" event = fires when recognition stops.

.start() = tells it to begin listening.
